## Phase 34 Batch Notice Generation Log (2026-03-14)

### 34.1 batch_notice_jobs Table ✅
- Created `batch_notice_jobs` table with county FK, neighborhood_code, property_class, filters JSONB
- Tracks total_parcels, notices_generated, notices_failed, ai_drafted_count, status
- County-scoped RLS policies for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE
- Added `batch_job_id` FK column to notices table for batch linkage

### 34.2 useBatchNotices Hook ✅
- `useBatchNoticeJobs`: query batch jobs with status filter
- `useBatchNoticesByJob`: fetch all notices linked to a specific batch job
- `useCreateBatchNoticeJob`: full pipeline — fetch parcels, create job, generate notices (AI + template), persist to DB, update job stats
- `useBulkUpdateNoticeStatus`: batch-approve or batch-send all draft notices in a job
- Added `batch_notices_generated` and `batch_notices_status_changed` to TraceEventType

### 34.3 BatchNoticeDashboard UI ✅

- Dropped 2 bare `true` policies on certification_events, replaced with county-scoped equivalents
- PII (recipient_name, recipient_address) now county-isolated

### 33.3 Broken RLS Fix: 5 Tables ✅
- Fixed `profiles.id = auth.uid()` → `get_user_county_id()` on:
  segment_definitions (4 policies), segment_calibration_runs (2), cost_approach_runs (3),
  income_properties (4), income_approach_runs (3)

## Phase 8 Completion Log (2026-02-15)

### 8.1 Edge Function Tool Framework ✅
- Agentic loop with up to 3 tool rounds before streaming final response
- 7 tool definitions: search_parcels, fetch_comps, get_parcel_details, get_neighborhood_stats, get_recent_activity, navigate_to_parcel, get_workflow_summary
- Mode-aware tool filtering (Pilot gets all tools, Muse gets read-only subset)

### 8.2 Tool Execution Handlers ✅
- Each tool queries live database via service client
- fetch_comps: neighborhood + value-range matching with subject context
- get_neighborhood_stats: computes median/avg/min/max from parcel population
- navigate_to_parcel: returns client-side navigation intent

### 8.3 Chat UI Tool Rendering ✅
- Tool call badges with per-tool icons (Search, MapPin, BarChart3, etc.)
- Active tool execution spinner with tool-specific labels
- Tool metadata streamed as SSE event prefix before content tokens
- Suggestion chips for common Pilot queries

### 8.4 Workbench Navigation Wiring ✅
- navigate_to_parcel tool triggers React Router navigation to /property/:id
- Tab switching via tool result (summary/forge/atlas/dais/dossier)
- handleNavigationAction callback integrated into stream parser

### 6.4 Comp Review ✅
- CompMode with neighborhood ratio grid
- Color-coded flags (green/yellow/red), Median Ratio, COD
- "Send to Workbench" per-parcel action

### 6.5 Scenario Modeling ✅
- ScenarioMode shell for what-if analysis

### 6.6 Integration & Polish ✅

---

## Polish Sprint (2026-02-15)

- ✅ Stale metrics: useRatioAnalysis + useVEIData with 2min staleTime + refetchOnWindowFocus
- ✅ Activity Feed: Fixed TerraTrace reason rendering for status transitions
- ✅ Permit notes: Inline preview in PermitsWorkflow list items
