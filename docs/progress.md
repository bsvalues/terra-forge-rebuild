- Write-lane matrix updated for forge domains

### 6.1 Factory Shell ✅
- `/factory` and `/factory/:mode` routes
- FactoryLayout with 4 mode tabs + NeighborhoodSelector
- Dock Launcher + SuiteHub integration

### 6.2 Regression Calibration ✅

- computeCostApproach pure function

### 6.4 Comp Review ✅
- CompMode with neighborhood ratio grid
- Color-coded flags (green/yellow/red), Median Ratio, COD
- "Send to Workbench" per-parcel action

### 6.5 Scenario Modeling ✅
- ScenarioMode shell for what-if analysis

### 6.6 Integration & Polish ✅
- "Open in Factory" link from ForgeTab header
- Latest calibration_run banner in ForgeTab
- "Send to Workbench" links from CompMode rows
